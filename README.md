# Node.js

### Introduction:-
Creator of Node is Ryan Dahl . Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node JS is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.  It is used for Backend Services like API (Application Programming Interface). It is used to build Highly scalable, data intensive and real time apps. Node is something which can be run outside of Browser using Chrome’s V8 engine. NodeJS is used where capability is not available in browsers like FileSystem or network etc. Node is not a programming language or framework, it is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
* Node is Non-Blocking Asynchronous.
Node applications are single-threaded. That means a single thread is used to
serve all clients.
* Node is ideal for I/O intensive apps. 
* Don’t use Node for CPU intensive applications like video encoding. 
* Essentially, Node is a C++ program that embeds Chrome’s v8 engine, the fastest
JS engine in the world.
* In Node, we don’t have browser environment objects such as window or the
document object. Instead, we have other objects that are not available in
browsers, such as objects for working with the file system, network, operating
system, etc.
